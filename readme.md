# Scramble Square Puzzle Solver

A simple scramble square puzzle solver written in Python.

The algorithm is a brute force algorithm with backtracking as described in the paper [Using backtracking to solve the scramble squares puzzle by Brandt et al.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.953.6583&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
